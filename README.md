## 🏗 System Architecture
This repository serves as the **Master Hub**. It is engineered with **Orientation-Awareness** to provide a seamless interface across all hardware nodes (Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop).

### Key Features:
* **Dual-Axis UI:** Adaptive grid that reshapes based on `Portrait` or `Landscape` orientation.
* **Micro-Frame Logic:** Ensures game viewports remain visible even when browser navigation bars are present.
* **Instant-Snap Performance:** Zero-latency navigation between project sub-domains.
* **Unified Design System:** Signature Neon Blue/Pink color palette across all deployments.

## 🛠 Multi-Device Optimization
The hub uses a **Fluid Layout Engine** that calculates viewport safety zones in real-time.



### Orientation Protocols:
1.  **Vertical (Portrait):** Single-column stacked cards for thumb-friendly navigation.
2.  **Horizontal (Landscape):** Double-column grid to maximize screen real estate on wide displays.
